# Dataset ([visualizations](https://diffusekrona.github.io/gallery.html))

Our custom dataset contains high-quality generated images and input data. Each folder is named after a `subject` and includes two subfolders: `input` (containing subject images for fine-tuning Diffusion models) and `generated` (storing images produced by the fine-tuned model).


## üôè Acknowledgment
Some subject input images are sourced from [DreamBooth](https://dreambooth.github.io/) and [Custom Diffusion](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~custom-diffusion/), while the rest are collected from the web. The web-sourced data is acknowledged in the [paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2025/supplemental/Marjit_DiffuseKronA_A_Parameter_WACV_2025_supplemental.pdf).
